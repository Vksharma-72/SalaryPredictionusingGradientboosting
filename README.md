# 💼 Salary Prediction with Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning pipeline built using Python and Jupyter Notebook to predict salaries based on candidate features such as experience, test scores, and interview performance. The goal is to demonstrate how simple regression models can be applied to real-world HR or recruitment datasets.

## 📌 Project Overview

* **Tool Used:** Jupyter Notebook (Python)
* **ML Algorithm:** Linear Regression
* **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`
* **Dataset:** Custom or hypothetical dataset with columns like `Experience`, `Test Score`, `Interview Score`, and `Salary`

## 📊 Features Used

* **Experience (Years)**
* **Test Score (Out of 10)**
* **Interview Score (Out of 10)**

These features are used to predict the **Salary** of an individual.

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values
   * Normalize or clean the data
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Correlation analysis
   * Data visualization
3. **Model Training**

   * Linear regression from `sklearn`
   * Split data into training/testing (if applicable)
4. **Prediction**

   * Make salary predictions based on new input values
   * Save and use the trained model

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/Vksharma-72/Salary-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SalaryPrediction.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Sample Output

Model predicts salary based on:

* `Experience = 2 years`
* `Test Score = 9`
* `Interview Score = 6`

> **Predicted Salary:** `$X,XXX`

*(Actual output shown in the notebook)*

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Include more features (education level, job role, etc.)
* Try different regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Add web interface using Flask or Streamlit
